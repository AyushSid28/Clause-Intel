    "liquidation": {
        "explanation": "A 1x liquidation preference means investors will recoup their initial investment before any common stockholders receive funds during liquidation. This creates a risk for common stockholders, especially if the company's liquidation value falls short of expected valuations.",

        "explanation": "The pre-money valuation of $5M is set, limiting the upside potential for current investors if the company grows significantly. Investors may face risks if the valuation does not increase substantially with future funding rounds.",
